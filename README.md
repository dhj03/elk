# The Extended Latin Keyboard (ELK)

The ELK is an AutoHotKey script that is able to type every Latin character, every diacritic, and every possible combination of them whether pre-composed or not. It is also able to type characters used in Latin-based phonetic scripts ranging from the IPA to Teuthonista, and everything in between.

This script supports all characters in the following Unicode blocks:
* [Latin-1 Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-1_Supplement) | [Latin Extended Additional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended_Additional)
* Latin Extended-\[ [A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-A) | [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-B) | [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-C) | [D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-D) | [E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-E) | [F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-F) | [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-G) \]
* [IPA Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_Extensions) | [Phonetic Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_Extensions) | [Phonetic Extensions Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_Extensions_Supplement)
* [Superscripts and Subscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscripts_and_Subscripts) | [Spacing Modifier Letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_Modifier_Letters) | [Modifier Tone Letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifier_Tone_Letters)
* [Combining Diacritical Marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_Diacritical_Marks) | [Combining Diacritical Marks Extended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_Diacritical_Marks_Extended) | [Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_Diacritical_Marks_Supplement)

It also supports some characters in other blocks also used in the IPA.
