# The Extended Latin Keyboard (ELK)

The ELK is an AutoHotKey script that is able to type every Latin character, every diacritic, and every possible combination of them whether pre-composed or not. It is also able to type characters used in Latin-based phonetic scripts ranging from the IPA to Teuthonista, and everything in between.

This script supports all characters in the following Unicode blocks:
* Latin-1 Supplement
* Latin Extended Additional
* Latin Extended-\[A/B/C/D/E/F/G\]
* IPA Extensions
* Phonetic Extensions
* Phonetic Extensions Supplement
* Spacing Modifier Letters
* Superscripts and Subscripts
* Modifier Tone Letters
* Combining Diacritical Marks
* Combining Diacritical Marks Extended
* Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement

It also supports some characters in other blocks also used in the IPA.

## Installation
* Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) at version 2.0 or newer.
* Place the `.ahk` file (the script) in your start-up folder.
* Run the script.

The script should now automatically run once every time your machine boots.
